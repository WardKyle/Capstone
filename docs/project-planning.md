# Capstone Project Planning Week 1 Homework

### Definition statement:

I wanted to build an application that simplifies the experience for a user to maintain, search, and organize passwords. Still using sticky notes, or cluttered Google Sheets files? Through a streamlined user-interface adding new passwords, editing stored passwords, and even searching for a single password has never been easier. Save time, let PassLockr store your personal information. Improve your security, let PassLockr create stronger passwords for you.

### Define Audience

This application will apply to anyone looking for an easier way to organize all of their passwords. The simplistic nature of this application enables an extremely broad and inclusive target audience.
